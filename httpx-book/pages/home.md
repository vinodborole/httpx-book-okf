# HTTPX

HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

Install HTTPX using pip:

```
$ pip install httpx
```
Now, let's get started:

```
>>> import httpx
>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')
>>> r
<Response [200 OK]>
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
>>> r.text
'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'
```
Or, using the command-line client.

```
# The command line client is an optional dependency.
$ pip install 'httpx[cli]'
```
Which now allows us to use HTTPX directly from the command-line...

Sending a request...

## Features

HTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:

- A broadly requests-compatible API.
- Standard synchronous interface, but with async support if you need it.
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.
- Ability to make requests directly to WSGI applications or ASGI applications.
- Strict timeouts everywhere.
- Fully type annotated.
- 100% test coverage.

Plus all the standard features of `requests`...

- International Domains and URLs
- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
- Sessions with Cookie Persistence
- Browser-style SSL Verification
- Basic/Digest Authentication
- Elegant Key/Value Cookies
- Automatic Decompression
- Automatic Content Decoding
- Unicode Response Bodies
- Multipart File Uploads
- HTTP(S) Proxy Support
- Connection Timeouts
- Streaming Downloads
- .netrc Support
- Chunked Requests

## Documentation

For a run-through of all the basics, head over to the QuickStart.

For more advanced topics, see the **Advanced** section,
the async support section, or the HTTP/2 section.

The Developer Interface provides a comprehensive API reference.

To find out about tools that integrate with HTTPX, see Third Party Packages.

## Dependencies

The HTTPX project relies on these excellent libraries:

- `httpcore`- The underlying transport implementation for- `httpx`.
- `h11`- HTTP/1.1 support.
- `certifi`- SSL certificates.
- `idna`- Internationalized domain name support.
- `sniffio`- Async library autodetection.

As well as these optional installs:

- `h2`- HTTP/2 support.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[http2]`)
- `socksio`- SOCKS proxy support.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[socks]`)
- `rich`- Rich terminal support.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[cli]`)
- `click`- Command line client support.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[cli]`)
- `brotli`or- `brotlicffi`- Decoding for "brotli" compressed responses.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[brotli]`)
- `zstandard`- Decoding for "zstd" compressed responses.- *(Optional, with*- `httpx[zstd]`)

A huge amount of credit is due to `requests` for the API layout that
much of this work follows, as well as to `urllib3` for plenty of design
inspiration around the lower-level networking details.

## Installation

Install with pip:

```
$ pip install httpx
```
Or, to include the optional HTTP/2 support, use:

```
$ pip install httpx[http2]
```
To include the optional brotli and zstandard decoders support, use:

```
$ pip install httpx[brotli,zstd]
```
HTTPX requires Python 3.9+
